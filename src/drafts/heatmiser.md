A case for Elliott's

An unspoiled gem before Elliott jumped to noteriety 

Elliott's precursor to fame bathed in amber.

More about the presentation than content

Good music is good no matter the date of creation, by accident, or not the best of someone.

Blue Highway feels like a punch in the nose. The Fix is In is the bloody trace.

Refreshing to hear a familiar artist paint with different colors.
