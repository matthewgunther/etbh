The inaugural induction into **The Canon** is an album that is dear to my heart. My mom used to buy CDs at Target, and she picked up *808s & Heartbreak* (and *The Blueprint 3*) for her Toyota Rav4 after moving to Colorado. At first the album was lost on me; but one morning we played "Paranoid" on the stereo while driving through the enveloping white of a snowy mountain road. From the backseat, something clicked. I fell in love with sound of Kanye's album and the Rav4's stereo system.




Ideas:
- place it in the time of writing: kanye lost his mother
- melodically prominent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrN_pbj2Kds (3:02)
- departure from previous rap soul samples
- auto tune reduces sonics to a study of melody, not about vocal performance, purity of the musical idea
