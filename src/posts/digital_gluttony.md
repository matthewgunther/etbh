This reflection on modern music consumption was sparked by Mark Fisher's *Capitalist Realism*. Fisher illustrates the notion that capitalism binds its participants into a state of addictive consumption framed as a system to fulfill their desires. The most affected exist in a parisitic haze of constant consumption. Depressive hedonia transfers a longing for deeper human fulfillment into strained grasping for meaning from a social media feed. In the strictest sense the subjugation of this system is voluntary. Even if all actors, from the content providers to the users, are well meaning, the design of the interaction is corrupting. *"While the structure remains, the vices will reproduce themselves."*

Fisher's analysis is bleak. The vein of hope is an awakening out of perpetual amenesia of genuine, purposeful community which exists outside of these vapid social media streams and cookie cutter mass market products. Art can shake and inspire new generations. Fisher states that *"cravings for the strange, the unexpected, the weird"* enables real perspective shifts that *"can only be supplied by artists and media professionals who are prepared to give people something different from that which already satisfies them."* Fisher quotes Adam Curtis who articulates the spirit which results from the best, most compelling art *"we can free you from yourself."*

Has anyone been freeing us? My largest point of disagreement with Fisher's account of capitalism is that culture has stalled; We are endlessly rehashing old ideas, mixing and matching styles to generate totally unoriginal work. This is far from the truth. (See appendix.)

For starters digital production has only become possible as long as computers could support it. Purely from the perspective of genre creation, digital audio production gave birth to hip hop and electronic dance music. Genres with massively talented stars and far-stretching futures. Digital audio production also removes barriers of entry for new artists to record and produce music. The Indie Pop sub-genre Bedroom Pop is named after this phenomenon of artists whose laptop is an entire home studio.

The internet defines modern music distribution and discovery. Any artist, any release, is available. Music videos don't need professional shoots or a cable network's airtime. The rate at which media is shared, copied, mixed, mashed, stolen, chopped, inhaled by us, the end user, is incomprehensible. Cultural progression is becoming more fluid. We can converse without finite statements to an explicit party.

Drake has built a career on adopting musical styles. There's a lot to not like about this practice, but it's so transparent, it's comical. The fact is that everyone only recognizes it, because they have access to all of the styles which he has bitten. Drake's career of being a sonic chamelion and our collective characterization is exemplary of the musical diaspora that the internet has afforded us.

Ubiquitous access to art gives us better access makes the good stuff possible to find. It also leads to digital gluttony. Gross consumption. Examining streaming services specifically, a fixed price for infinite listening means that every waking moment can be crammed with music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Silence no longer needs to be endured. Unpleasent thoughts can be steam rolled with an endless catalog of content. For serious music listeners, these are favorable economics. But when we are constanly listening, music (and more broadly art) is no longer a scarce reprieve. This is the sharpest consequence of infinite access. Culture is as rich as ever. There are still moving performances. There are still artists mastering their craft. But our ever obliging ear buds are a gateway to a deadly sin. Digital gluttony is deadly, because it robs impactful art of the potency which might save us.
