## Framing

This is an investigation into the claim made by Mark Fisher in Capitalist Realism that culture is thwarted by capitalism. That capitalism's dynamic to squeeze every ounce of profit from genuine artistic expression robs it of its potency. Commodifying a scene turns real social community into a commercial participation.

The barrier for publishing music, and posting media in general, has diminished entirely. No longer are artists dependent on record labels to fund and distribute their music. An entire genre, Bedroom Pop, is the result of being able to record and produce without professional studio equipment. Although at the cost of production quality, the artistic intention is true. This is the wave ushered in by Claire O and carried forth by Still Woozy, headlining massive tours.

Alongside music distribution, at-home creatives have found significant success on platforms such as YouTube or Twitch. There is merit to Fischer's point that capitalism consumes the next wave, making it instantly uncool. Web content is fresh, exciting, and free only until it reaches a critical mass of viewers when ads, sponsorships, and merchandise are interjected. Capitalism as an economic model can be critiqued, but I find it comforting that there is at least a change of guard in content creation. New voices should be welcomed. Removing barriers for talented people to make a living off of their creative work is good.

As I cannot remember a time before the internet, I am not able to compare pre-internet music distribution to today's. However, even since the early 2000s, music consumption has become dramatically cheaper and more enjoyable. Barring illegal methods, purchasing music at the scale it is consumed now would be dizzing for some listeners. I would mine Pandora like a slot machine to hear a specific craving, or transfer the meager offerings from my cousin's iTunes library to my MP3 player. In an age of streaming, nearly every muiscal work that could have been reasonably sourced is at the listener's ready.

Okay, so what, does this just accelerate the inevitable commercialization of artists? Are scenes eroded due to uniquitous access? I feel music lovers of Fischer's era, and perhaps this is just a projection, almost enjoy bemoaning the success of new artists. Their scene was truly authentic. One hit wonders are just as prevalent. Remember when Khalid released ten songs that all sounded like Location? Fetty Wap also suffered a tragic fate. Remember how the sound Claire O pioneered was immediately saturated? How Brockhampton released a stream of albums, a member was jetissoned, the group imploded, and I'm honestly not sure if there is any wake?

However, while streaming can be especially cruel to one-dimensional artists that are washed away with the tide, some artists have built impressive discographies. Brittany Howard has steadily produced innovative, technically excellent work. Solo carriers such as hers are prime examples to not underestimate the power of the hyperlink. Streaming services as networks of distributed media are under appreciated as artists collaborate, feature, and expand their work is easier to find. Plus the listener is unincumbered by a paywall when they do go exploring.

I think the most legitimate criticism of streaming is that it becomes a platform for nosy music distributors to wave the latest pop prop in front of your face. But if paid placement appeals to you, I think you will largely be indifferent to the machine. I also posit these are not the votes that count. These are the folks on the receiving end of cultural taste. That is okay. The listenability of popular music? Yeah, that was priced in.

## Quotes
- No cultural object can retain its power when there are no longer new eyes to see it. (p. 4)
- The 'realism' he is analagous to the defaltionary perspective of a depressive who believe that any positive state, any hope, is a dangerous illusion. (p. 5)
- What we are delaing with now, however, is a deeper far more pervasive, sense of exhaustion, of cultural and political sterility (p. 7)
- Witness, for instance, the establishment of settled 'alternative' or 'independent' cultural zones, which endlessly repeat older gestures of rebellion and contestation as if for the first time. 'Alternative' and 'independent' don't designate something outside mainstream culture; rather, they are styles, in fact the dominant styles, within the mainstream. (p. 9)
- Subjugation no longer takes the form of a subordination to an extrinsic spectacle, but rather invites us to interact and participate. (p. 12)
- So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is bad, we are free to continue to participate in captalist exchange. (p. 13)
- depressive hedonia ... a inability to do anything else except pursue pleasure (p. 22)

separate pastiche from genuine novelty
to the less web-nimble many gems may be lost to spotify spamming the latest john mayer single
it's also nobody's fault if you are too stuck in the sonic nostalgia of your youth to give new styles a chance. One cannot simultaneously claim that culture is stagnant and bemoan the new (and popular) cultural strains.

- Virgil Abloh
- Frank Ocean
