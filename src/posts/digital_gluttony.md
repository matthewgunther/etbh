This reflection on the modern music ecosystem was sparked by Mark Fisher's *Capitalist Realism*. Fisher's central claim is that capitalism binds its participants into a state of addictive consumption framed as a system to fulfill their desires. Depressive hedonia transmutes a longing for deep human fulfillment into a perpetual grasping for meaning from social media feeds and mass market products which always fail to deliver. In the strictest sense this subjugation is voluntary. The machine we have built is based on the notion that the goods and services we exchange create meaning. Even if all actors--from the producers to the consumers--are well meaning, the design of the interaction is corrupting. *"While the structure remains, the vices will reproduce themselves."*

Fisher's analysis is bleak. He views authentic culture as becoming commodified and corrupted. The vein of hope is an awakening from the amenesia of genuine, purposeful community outside of capitalist economics. Art can shake and inspire new generations. Fisher states that *"cravings for the strange, the unexpected, the weird"* enables real perspective shifts that *"can only be supplied by artists and media professionals who are prepared to give people something different from that which already satisfies them."* He quotes Adam Curtis who articulates the spirit of the most compelling art pieces: *"we can free you from yourself."*

Has anyone been freeing us? My largest point of disagreement with Fisher's account of capitalism is that culture has stalled. I don't believe that challenging, innovative art does not exist. It may not be played on the radio, but it is available. (See appendix.)

For starters, digital music production has only become possible with the onset of the computing revolution. Purely from the perspective of genre creation, computers have defined modern hip hop and electronic dance music--both genres with massively talented stars and far-stretching futures. Digital audio production also removes barriers of entry for new artists to record and produce music. The Indie Pop sub-genre Bedroom Pop is named after this phenomenon of artists who substiute a recording studio with a laptop.

Further, the internet and its extension to mobile devices defines modern music distribution and discovery. Any recording from any artist is available. Music videos don't require professional shoots or a cable network's airtime. The rate at which media is shared, copied, mixed, mashed, stolen, chopped, and inhaled by audiences is incomprehensible. Cultural progression is becoming more fluid. Global cultures don't converse with finite statements between explicit parties, but in a mixing of diverse style and substance.

Drake has built a career on adopting (and commodifying) musical styles. This is emblematic of Fisher's claim, but Drake's lack of originality is so transparent that it's comical. His pastiching is obvious because we have access to all of the styles which he has ripped off. Drake's career will be remembered for marketable pop music, not groundbreaking artisty. But it is his being a sonic chamelion that is exemplary of the musical diaspora that the internet has afforded the world.

Ubiquitous access to art makes the good stuff possible to find. But it also leads to digital gluttony. Gross consumption. Examining streaming services specifically, a fixed price for infinite listening means that every waking moment can be crammed with music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Silence no longer needs to be endured. Unpleasant thoughts can be steamrolled with an endless catalog of content. For serious music listeners, these are favorable economics. But when we are constanty listening, music is no longer a scarce reprieve. This is the most damaging consequence of infinite access. Culture is as rich as ever. There are still moving performances. There are still artists mastering their craft. But 
this abundance is a gateway to a deadly sin. Digital gluttony is dangerous, because it robs impactful art of the potency which might save us.
