## Framing

This reflection on modern music consumption was sparked by Mark Fisher's *Capitalist Realism*. Fisher illustrates the notion is that capitalism binds its participants into a state of addictive consumption framed as a system to fulfill their desires. The most effected exist in parisitic haze of constant consumption. Depressive hedonia transfers a longing for deeper human fulfillment into strained grasping for meaning from a social media feed. In this way the subjugation of this system is voluntary in the strictest sense. Even if all actors from the content providers to the users are well meaning, the design of the interaction is corrupting. "While the structure remains, the vices will reproduce themselves."

This analysis is bleak. Is there a shread of hope? The vein of hope is an awakening out of perpetual amenesia that genuine, purposeful interaction exists outside of these exchanges whether vapid social media streams or cookie cutter mass market products. Art can shake and inspire new generations. Fisher's identification of that *"cravings for the strange, the unexpected, the weird"* enables really perspective shifts that *"can only be supplied by artists and media professionals who are prepared to give people something different from that which already satisfies them."* Fisher quotes Adam Curtis who puts forth the spirit which results from the best, most compelling art *"we can free you from yourself."*

Has anyone been freeing us? My largest point of dissagreement with Fisher's account of capitalism is that culture has stalled. We are endlessly rehashing old ideas, mixing and matching styles to generate totally unoriginal work. This is far from the truth.

For starters digital production has only become possible as long as computers could support it. Purely from the perspective of genre creation, digital audio production gave birth to hip hop and electronic dance music. Genres with massively talented stars and far-stretching futures. Digital audio production also removes barriers of entry for new artists to record and produce music. The Indie Pop sub-genre Bedroom Pop is centered on artists whose laptop is their home studio.

The internet defines modern music distribution and discovery. Any artist, any release, is available. Music videos don't need professional shoots or a cable network's airtime. The rate at which media is shared, copied, mixed, mashed, stolen, chopped, and inhaled by us, the end user, is incomprehensible. Cultural progression is becoming more fluid. We can converse without finite statements to an explicit other party.

Drake has built a career on adopting musical styles. There's a lot to not like about this practice, but everyone's gotta make a buck. It's so transparent, it's comical. But the fact is that everyone recognizes it, because they have access to all of the styles which Drake has bitten. Drake's career of being a sonic chamelion and our collective characterization is exemplary of the musical diaspora that the internet has afforded us.

Ubiquitous access to art gives us better access makes the good stuff possible to find. It also leads to digital gluttony. Gross consumption. Examining streaming services specifically, a fixed price for infinite listening means that every waking moment can be crammed with music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Silence no longer need to be endured when creeping thoughts are steam rolled with an endless catalog of content. For serious music listeners, these are favorable economics. But when we are constanly listening, music (slash art) are no longer the scarce reprieve of escape. I think this is the sharpest consequence of infinite access. Culture is as rich as ever. There are still moving performances. There are still artists mastering their craft. Our ever obliging ear buds are a gateway to sin. Ultimately a sin against what might save us.



















This is an investigation into the claim made by Mark Fisher in Capitalist Realism that culture is thwarted by capitalism. That capitalism's dynamic to squeeze every ounce of profit from genuine artistic expression robs it of its potency. Commodifying a scene turns real social community into a commercial participation.

The barrier for publishing music, and posting media in general, has diminished entirely. No longer are artists dependent on record labels to fund and distribute their music. An entire genre, Bedroom Pop, is the result of being able to record and produce without professional studio equipment. Although at the cost of production quality, the artistic intention is true. This is the wave ushered in by Claire O and carried forth by Still Woozy, headlining massive tours.

Alongside music distribution, at-home creatives have found significant success on platforms such as YouTube or Twitch. There is merit to Fischer's point that capitalism consumes the next wave, making it instantly uncool. Web content is fresh, exciting, and free only until it reaches a critical mass of viewers when ads, sponsorships, and merchandise are interjected. Capitalism as an economic model can be critiqued, but I find it comforting that there is at least a change of guard in content creation. New voices should be welcomed. Removing barriers for talented people to make a living off of their creative work is good.

As I cannot remember a time before the internet, I am not able to compare pre-internet music distribution to today's. However, even since the early 2000s, music consumption has become dramatically cheaper and more enjoyable. Barring illegal methods, purchasing music at the scale it is consumed now would be dizzing for some listeners. I would mine Pandora like a slot machine to hear a specific craving, or transfer the meager offerings from my cousin's iTunes library to my MP3 player. In an age of streaming, nearly every muiscal work that could have been reasonably sourced is at the listener's ready.

Okay, so what, does this just accelerate the inevitable commercialization of artists? Are scenes eroded due to uniquitous access? I feel music lovers of Fischer's era, and perhaps this is just a projection, almost enjoy bemoaning the success of new artists. Their scene was truly authentic. One hit wonders are just as prevalent. Remember when Khalid released ten songs that all sounded like Location? Fetty Wap also suffered a tragic fate. Remember how the sound Claire O pioneered was immediately saturated? How Brockhampton released a stream of albums, a member was jetissoned, the group imploded, and I'm honestly not sure if there is any wake?

However, while streaming can be especially cruel to one-dimensional artists that are washed away with the tide, some artists have built impressive discographies. Brittany Howard has steadily produced innovative, technically excellent work. Solo carriers such as hers are prime examples to not underestimate the power of the hyperlink. Streaming services as networks of distributed media are under appreciated as artists collaborate, feature, and expand their work is easier to find. Plus the listener is unincumbered by a paywall when they do go exploring.

I think the most legitimate criticism of streaming is that it becomes a platform for nosy music distributors to wave the latest pop prop in front of your face. But if paid placement appeals to you, I think you will largely be indifferent to the machine. I also posit these are not the votes that count. These are the folks on the receiving end of cultural taste. That is okay. The listenability of popular music? Yeah, that was priced in.






Streaming has made music extremely accessable. I myself must admit it has become a bad habit to pop in earbuds immediately after getting out of bed. Putting on music or a podcast while I get ready in the morning. In this instance I do feel I am acting as the "debtor-addict" which Fischer outlines. I am still wrestling with what the cause of this is. Am I bored? Does it distract As I pull myself in shape to start my day? Perhaps I am just addicted to stimulating media. However, you slice it, it's not healthy. But, as a music lover, the more compelling argument to stop this practice (more compelling than caring for my own mental health) is that it diminishes the sacred aspects of listening to music. It is a facet of a larger spread digital glutony.

## Quotes
- No cultural object can retain its power when there are no longer new eyes to see it. (p. 4)
- The 'realism' he is analagous to the defaltionary perspective of a depressive who believe that any positive state, any hope, is a dangerous illusion. (p. 5)
- What we are dealing with now, however, is a deeper far more pervasive, sense of exhaustion, of cultural and political sterility (p. 7)
- Witness, for instance, the establishment of settled 'alternative' or 'independent' cultural zones, which endlessly repeat older gestures of rebellion and contestation as if for the first time. 'Alternative' and 'independent' don't designate something outside mainstream culture; rather, they are styles, in fact the dominant styles, within the mainstream. (p. 9)
- Subjugation no longer takes the form of a subordination to an extrinsic spectacle, but rather invites us to interact and participate. (p. 12)
- So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is bad, we are free to continue to participate in captalist exchange. (p. 13)
- depressive hedonia ... a inability to do anything else except pursue pleasure (p. 22)
- the consequence of being hooked into the entertainment matrix is twitchy, agitated interpassivity, an inability to concentrate or focus(p. 24)
- If the figure of discipline was the worker-prisoner, the figure of control is the debtor-actor(p. 25)
- we are integrated into a control circuit that has our desires and preferences as its only mandate - but those desires and preferences are returned to us, no longer as ours, but as the desires of a the big Other (p. 49)
- surely on the contrary, it is evident that the vices are engendered by the structure, and that while the structure remains, the vices will reproduce themselves. (p. 68)
- far from being an aberrant condition, addiction is the standard state for human beings, who are habitually enslaved into reactive and repetitive behaviors by frozen images (of themselves and the world). Freedom ... is something that can be *achieved* only when we can apprehend the real causes of our actions, when we can set aside the 'sad passions' that intoxicate and entrance us. (p. 73)
- '"we can free you from yourself" -- and people would love it.' (p. 75)
- By contrast, it is paternalistic cultural products that treat audiences as adults, assuminv that they can cope with cultural products that are complex and intellectually demanding. (p. 75 )  <-- challenging gender roles?
- the most powerful forms of desire are precisely cravings for the strange, the unexpected, the weird. These can only be supplied by artists and media professionals who are prepared to give people something differet form that which already satisfies them.(p. 76)

separate pastiche from genuine novelty
to the less web-nimble many gems may be lost to spotify spamming the latest john mayer single
it's also nobody's fault if you are too stuck in the sonic nostalgia of your youth to give new styles a chance. One cannot simultaneously claim that culture is stagnant and bemoan the new (and popular) cultural strains.
